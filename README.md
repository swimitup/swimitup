Julian Aoki Romero aka @swimitup
ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
Analyst, consultant, swimming projects and web apps developer.
Present in the web since 1995, launched my main service on 1996: Swim It Up!

A swimming pool is never empty: We are always filling water in it.
This is what I thought about business and technology in swimming: 
there's no finish lap when working with sport, it's a constant work managing excellence. 
Once the pool is broken or the service is unsatisfying, people do not stop swimming, they simply search other pool to be happy with. 
That's why I am focused on customized project development for the clients, 
creating strong business relationship and delivering outstanding support.
